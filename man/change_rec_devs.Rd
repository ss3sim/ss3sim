\title{Replace recruitment deviations}
\usage{
change_rec_devs(recdevs, ctl_file_in, ctl_file_out = "control_recruitment.ss")
}
\arguments{
\item{recdevs}{A vector of recruitment deviations to be entered into
the Stock Synthesis control file. The vector must be the same length as the vector
of recruitment deviations that are commented out in the \code{ss_new}
control file. This vector can be found by searching for
\verb{# all recruitment deviations} within the file.
If a single value is provided instead of a vector, the value
will be repeated for every recruitment deviation in the model.
Alternatively, users can supply a named vector with each name being a year
of the model. Missing years will be filled in with values of zero.}

\item{ctl_file_in}{A string providing the path to the input SS \code{.ctl} file.}

\item{ctl_file_out}{A string providing the path to the output SS control file. If the value is \code{NULL}, the file will not be written to the disk.}
}
\value{
A modified Stock Synthesis control file.
}
\description{
This function replaces the recruitment deviations in the
control file of a Stock Synthesis model with those specified in the argument
\code{recdevs}. The new control file is then written to the disk if
\code{ctl_file_out} is specified.
It is imperative that the path provided in \code{ctl_file_in}
be to a \code{ss_new} file so \code{change_rec_devs} can
properly determine where to place the recruitment deviations
in the control file.
