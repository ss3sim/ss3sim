#' Replace recruitment deviations
#'
#' This function replaces the recruitment deviations in the
#' control file of a Stock Synthesis model with those specified in the argument
#' `recdevs`. The new control file is then written to the disk if
#' `ctl_file_out` is specified.
#' It is imperative that the path provided in `ctl_file_in`
#' be to a `ss_new` file so `change_rec_devs` can
#' properly determine where to place the recruitment deviations
#' in the control file.
#'
#' @param recdevs A vector of recruitment deviations to be entered into
#' the Stock Synthesis control file. The vector must be the same length as the vector
#' of recruitment deviations that are commented out in the `ss_new`
#' control file. This vector can be found by searching for
#' `# all recruitment deviations` within the file.
#' If a single value is provided instead of a vector, the value
#' will be repeated for every recruitment deviation in the model.
#' Alternatively, users can supply a named vector with each name being a year
#' of the model. Missing years will be filled in with values of zero.
#' @template ctl_file_in
#' @template ctl_file_out
#' @return A modified Stock Synthesis control file.
