get_results_iter(dir_1_iter = NULL, mod_dirs = NULL, iter_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir_1_iter}{The full or relative path to the Stock Synthesis iteration folder.
Assumed to contain multiple model folders that contain "om" or "em"
(not case sensitive) somewhere in the model file name. If specified,
mod_dirs need not be specified.}

\item{mod_dirs}{The full or relative path to the Stock Synthesis model folders as a
vector of characters. If specified, dir_1_iter need not be specified.}

\item{iter_name}{Name of the iteration, which will be appended to the
dataframes . Defaults to NULL, in which case the iter_name will be the
folder name of dir_1_iter or the folder name 1 level up from the first
mod_dirs specified}
