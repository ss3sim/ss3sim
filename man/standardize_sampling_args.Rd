\usage{
standardize_sampling_args(
  fleets,
  years,
  other_input,
  return_val = "other_input",
  other_input_name = "other_input"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fleets}{Fleet numbers as a vector.}

\item{years}{Number of years as a list.
The number of list components should be one or the same length as fleets.
Within the list components
should be a vector of years to correspond with each fleet.}

\item{other_input}{Some other input to interpret.
The number of list components should be one or the same length as fleets.
Within the list components
should be a vector of length 1 the same length as the vectors within years.}

\item{return_val}{If \code{other_input}, return the manipulated other_input value;
if \code{years}, return the manipulated year input.
If "both" return both as list components.}

\item{other_input_name}{Only necessary if \code{both} is used as the return value.}
