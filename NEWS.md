# ss3sim 1.19.1

* Updates `change_q()` to more modern code, and while doing so
  a few bugs were noticed. Errors are no longer generated when
  the fleet doesn't exist.
* `find_position()` simplifies the code to find the position of
  a fleet name in a vector. As well as, the code was moved to an
  exported function for others to use outside of `change_q()`.

# ss3sim 1.19.0

* Bump version to match current version of SS3,
  where version numbers of {ss3sim} include three parts separated by full stops.
  The first number represents the major version of {ss3sim}.
  The second number is the minor version, i.e.,
  third set of digits, of the SS3 executable used in this version of {ss3sim}.
  The third number is the minor version of {ss3sim}.

* Remove dependency on {bbmle} to externally estimate growth.

* Deprecate functions that were not being used in the code base, i.e.,
  `cleanup_ss3()`, `get_bin_info()`, `change_rec_devs_par()`, ...

* Does not turn on empirical weight-at-age in EM if sampling weight-at-age data.
  Instead, users must specify to use empirical weight-at-age data in their
  control file for the estimation method allowing users to sample the data but
  not use it if they do not want to.

* Allows for no estimation method via `em_dir = NA`,
  creating a way to simulate data quickly.

# ss3sim 1.1.8

* Fix bug related to {tidyverse} in `sample_comp()` where the composition
  data were appended to the data frame as a matrix rather than integrated
  as additional columns.

# ss3sim 1.1.7

* Deprecate the use of the log file in `ss3sim_base()`.
  The argument `ss3sim_base(print_logfile = FALSE)` has a new default and
  will warn users if they have the value set to `TRUE` that no log file will be printed.
  Users can look at the results files to get most of this information.

* Create data objects for the OM and EM control and data files.
  These files are often used in examples.

# ss3sim 1.1.6
* Deprecate change_f_par which was not being used by any downstream code.
Feel free to contact the package maintainers if you wish to reinstate this function,
but ss3sim uses the control file instead of the par file as in the original ss3sim.
* Move [Anderson et al. (2014)](www.github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim_andersonetal)
  to a dedicated repository

# ss3sim 1.1.1

* Allow for custom name of results files

# ss3sim 1.1.0

* Upgrade to SS3.30.15.03
* Deprecate case files in favor of `simdf`, an argument passed to `run_ss3sim()`
* Use more templates for parameter arguments, e.g., par_int
* Simplify scenarios, iterations, EM/OM to `dir` to increase the usability
of functions outside of {ss3sim}
* Add as.is for all calls to type.convert because of an upgrade within R 4.0
* Use `maxfn 0` to increase speed of tests and run more tests on CRAN check
* Figures: Use better labels for x and y axes in {ggplot2} figures;
  change relative error line to dashed black;
  pass coloration of lines in a better way;
  use `plot_ss3sim()` as back-end code for plotting functions;
  properly use character strings as input arguments with calls to data;
  add cumulative mean figure; allow for fill in box plots; 
* Results: long-data format for results to allow functions to be used by {SSMSE};
  remove columns that are not needed;
  remove row names in summary files;
  rename `rec_dev` to increase clarity;
  better grep of management quantities;
  remove parallel capacity;
  only read composition file if present by changing `SS_output(compfile = )`;
  allow for relative directories for {SSMSE} (a dependency)

# ss3sim 1.0.0

* Improved the documentation of many functions
* Updated, added, or removed examples increasing the number of functions with
helpful examples
* Update `profile_fmsy()` to allow for relative or absolute paths to directories
and provide a better message if verbose = TRUE warning users when they may have
not run their model long enough to reach equilibrium
* Remove reliance on {tidyverse} packages
* Change to 'iteration' instead of 'replicate'
* Update the license to 2019
* Change README from R markdown to markdown file
* Deleted the vignette on making functions and updated remaining vignettes
* Remove bias adjustment capability and sampling of conditional age-at-length
data; both will eventually be added back to the package with better code
* Remove write_file argument from many functions and rely on other input
arguments to determine if a file should be written to the disk, such as
if the name of the file is NULL then nothing is written
* Create change_o for the operating model so users can input `INIT` values
for parameters in their operating model rather than having to use a dev
vector and the `change_tv()` function
* Implement check of q parameter such that a given q is created from a template
for each survey-like data set included after sampling
* Manipulate control file rather than par file and delete the par
file from the operating model folder
* Use merge rather than `cbind` for those instances that the names of the 
columns in the results file from the OM do not exactly match the EM.
* Fix get_results working directory issue
* Deprecate `change_year()`, `change_fltname()`, `change_maturity()`, and `pastef()`
* Reduce restrictions placed on the operating and estimation models used
by individual users to allow for multiple fleets, two-sexed models, and other
trivial changes such as different fleet names. Feel free to email the
developers if there is a feature that you want or one that isn't working as
expected because more work in planned in this area.
* Implement the use of more {r4ss} functions such as `SS_readstarter()` and 
`SS_writestarter()` to decrease the amount of original code in {ss3sim}
* Increase the number of functions with examples and update examples
to not change the users working directory when possible.
* Change to providing a single model inside the package rather than
maintaining models both in the package and in {ss3models}
* Kelli F. Johnson is now the maintainer of the package
* updated authors to reflect current contributors
* reduced the complexity of sampling functions by initiating the same
protocol for ages and lengths, where each function calls a simple function

with SS 3.3.0, and change to using the newer executable of SS without the
option to specify safe or optimized

# ss3sim 0.9.5

* Fix issue with SS3 binary in development version #239

# ss3sim 0.9.3

* Fix LICENSE for CRAN
* Update author list 
* Incorporate additions by Christine Stawitz to the `making-models` vignette

# ss3sim 0.9.2

* Revise package description 

# ss3sim 0.9.1

* Fix compatibility with {dplyr} 0.4.3.9001.

# ss3sim 0.9.0

* Fix compatibility of vignette with {ggplot2} 2.0.0.

* Add new data types: conditional age at length, mean length at age, and
  empirical weight at age.

* `sample_agecomp` and `sample_lcomp` now take new effective sample size
  (ESS) argument as inputs, so the user can weight the composition data as
  desired.

* Add functions to estimate von Bertalanffy growth. These are used internally
  by `change_e()`.

* Add `change_maturity()` to alter the SS3 maturity option

* Check that fleet name in the data frame matches the newest SS3 version
  (see `change_fltname()`)

* Add `change_data()`, which prepares the OM data files to have the correct
  data used for sampling that scenario. It also can manipulate length
  bin widths, the SS3 robustification constant, and the SS3 tail
  compression value. It takes care of calling the new
  `change_tail_compression()` and `change_lcomp_constant()` functions.

* Add `calculate_re()` to calculate relative errors on the result data frames.

* Add internal checking of the validity of SS3 data files (#203)

* The `get_results` function now returns run time, a list of parameters that were
  on bounds, and recruitment deviations.

* Switch vignette to R Markdown and HTML output (#194)

* Add re-binning within the estimation model of length and conditional
  age-at-length data (#201, #205)

* Add Kelli's `profile_fmsy()` function (#173)

* Merrill added parallel processing option to the get results functions (#171)

* Added parallel iterations processing option (#168)

* Function argument descriptions now indicate which ones need to be specified
  in case files with an asterisk (#161).

* Merrill updated the get-results functions to work without bias runs, to
  check for folders that look like ss3sim runs, and to issue a warning if
  there are problems reading the files (#155).

* Copy `wtatage.ss_new` from OM to EM (#163).

* Add Travis CI testing of the package https://travis-ci.org/ss3sim/ss3sim

* Added much more extensive testing of the package in the root `tests` folder.
  This is for internal testing only and not bundled with the package (#156).

* Allow for missing arguments in case files. This allows us to add new
  arguments to existing functions without breaking old code. A missing
  argument gets passed as `NULL` via the `add_nulls()` function (within #148).

* Re-write case file parsing to be more robust and allow for scientific
  notations (#157).

* Add the option to use the optimized SS executables (#138 and #147) and
  ability to have spaces in the path name to the executable.

* Add ss3sim plotting functions (#134).

* `change_lcomp`, `change_agecomp`, and `change_index` are now `sample_lcomp`,
  `sample_agecomp`, and `sample_index`. The old functions point to the new
  functions with warnings that they are depreciated. Existing code should
  continue to work (#145).

* ss3sim now requires the SS3 binary to be named according to the version (#138
  and #147).

* Bump required version of r4ss to 1.22.1 since 1.22.0 did not export functions
  that ss3sim needs.

* ss3sim now requires R 3.1.0 since we cannot easily test on earlier versions.

# ss3sim 0.8.2

## New features

* Added ability to pass seed value to `get_recdevs()` (#125).

* Added dimension check of `user_recdevs` to ensure recruitment deviations are
  supplied for all iterations (#130).

* Vignette now uses a custom solar color theme.

## Bug fixes

* Moved vignette data files to the `data` folder so they are user-accessible
  after installing the package (#126).

* Updated out-dated paper citations. All papers are now accepted.

* Removed multi-core code in vignette for CRAN checks.
