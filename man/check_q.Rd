\title{Check if desired \eqn{q} parameters exist in control file list}
\usage{
check_q(ctl_list, Nfleets = lifecycle::deprecated(), desiredfleets)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctl_list}{A control file read in by \code{\link[r4ss]{SS_readctl}}.}

\item{Nfleets}{Deprecated with {ss3sim} version 1.19.1 because
the number of fleets is available in \code{ctl_list}.}

\item{desiredfleets}{A numeric vector specifying which fleets should have
catchability parameters.}
}
\value{
A list with two vectors, \code{add} and \code{remove},
specifying which fleets to add and which to remove from the control file.
}
\description{
Check a Stock Synthesis control file to determine if the desired fleets
have q parameters set up.
}
\examples{
# Keep just the fishery
stopifnot(check_q(ctl_list = codomctl, desiredfleets = 1)[["remove"]] == 2)
# All elements of the returned list should be NULL
# because the model only has two \eqn{q} parameters
stopifnot(all(mapply(is.null, check_q(codomctl, desiredfleets = 1:2))))
# Fleet 3 is not present
stopifnot(check_q(codomctl, desiredfleets = 1:3)[["add"]] == 3)
stopifnot(check_q(codomctl, desiredfleets = 2:3)[["remove"]] == 1)
}
\seealso{
\code{\link[=change_q]{change_q()}} for actually adding or removing the fleets.
