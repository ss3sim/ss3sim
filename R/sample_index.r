#' Sample the CPUE/index data with observation error
#'
#' Create new catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)/indices of abundance that are
#' based on the numbers in a data file. Typically the data file will be filled
#' with expected values rather than observed data but it does not have to be.
#' Sampling can only occur on fleets, years, and seasons that have current
#' observations. If rows of information are not sampled from, then they are
#' removed. So, you can take away rows of data but you cannot add them with
#' this function.
#'
#' @details
#' Limitations to the functionality of this function are as follows:
#' * you can only generate observations from rows of data that are present,
#'   e.g., you cannot make a new observation for a year that is not present in
#'   the passed data file;
#' * no warning will be given if some of the desired year, seas, fleet
#'   combinations are available but not all, instead just the combinations
#'   that are available will be returned in the data list object; and
#' * sampling uses a log-normal distribution when the log-normal distribution
#'   is specified in `CPUEinfo[["Errtype"]]` and a normal distribution for all
#'   other error types, see below for details on the log-normal sampling.
#'
#' Samples are generated using the following equation when the log-normal
#' distribution is specified:
#' \deqn{
#'   B_y*exp(stats::rnorm(1, 0, sds_obs)-sds_obs^2/2)
#' },
#' where \eqn{B_y} is the expected biomass in year y and \eqn{sds_obs} is the
#' standard deviation of the normally distributed biomass or the standard error
#' of the \eqn{log_e(B_y)}. For the error term, this is the same
#' parameterization that is used in Stock Synthesis. More details can be found
#' in the [section on indices in the Stock Synthesis
#' manual](https://nmfs-stock-synthesis.github.io/doc/SS330_User_Manual_release.html#indices)
#' The second term in the equation adjusts the random samples so their expected
#' value is \eqn{B_y}, i.e., the log-normal bias correction.
#'
#' If you only know the coefficient of variation (\eqn{CV}), then the input
#' error can be approximated using \eqn{\sqrt{log_e(1+CV^{2})}}. Where,
#' \eqn{CV} is assumed to be constant with mean changes in biomass. The
#' log-normal distribution can be approximated by a proportional distribution
#' or normal distribution only when the variance is low, i.e., \eqn{CV < 0.50}
#' or log standard deviation of 0.22.
#'
#' @param dat_list  A Stock Synthesis data list returned from
#'   [r4ss::SS_readdat()]. Typically, this will be read from a file that
#'   contains expected values rather than input values but any Stock Synthesis
#'   data file is fine.
#' @param fleets An integer vector specifying which fleets to sample from. The
#'   order of the fleets matters here because you must retain the ordering for
#'   all of the remaining input arguments. For example, both `fleets = c(1, 2)`
#'   and `fleets = c(2, 1)` will work but `years` will expect the years you
#'   want sampled for fleet 2 to be in the second position in the list in the
#'   former and the first position in the latter case. So, if you change the
#'   order of your input, you will also have to modify all of the remaining
#'   arguments. An entry of `fleets = NULL` will lead to no CPUE samples in the
#'   returned object.
#' @param years A list the same length as `fleets` specifying the years you
#'   want samples from. There must be an integer vector in the list for every
#'   fleet specified in `fleets`. The function assumes that the information for
#'   the first fleet specified in `fleets` will be the first object in the list
#'   and so on so order matters here.
#' @param outfile A deprecated argument.
#' @param sds_obs,sds_out,seas A list the same length as `fleets` specifying the
#'   standard deviation of the observation error used for the sampling; the
#'   standard deviation of the observation error you would like listed in the
#'   returned output, which might not always equal what was actually used for
#'   sampling; and the seasons you want to sample from. Each list element
#'   should contain a single numeric value or a vector, where vectors need to
#'   match the structure of `years` for the relevant fleet. If single values
#'   are passed, then, internally, they will be repeated for each year. If you
#'   want to repeat a single value for every year and fleet combination, then
#'   just pass it as a list with one entry, e.g., `seas = list(1)` will sample
#'   from season one for all fleets and years --- this is the default for
#'   season. The default for `sds_obs` is 0.01 and if `sds_out` is missing,
#'   then `sds_obs` will be used for the output as well as the input.
#'
#' @return
#' A Stock Synthesis data file list object is returned. The object will be a
#' modified version of `dat_list`.
