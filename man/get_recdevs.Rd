\title{Return a set of recruitment deviations}
\usage{
get_recdevs(iteration, n, seed = 21)
}
\arguments{
\item{iteration}{The iteration number. This is used as an ID to set the
random number seed.}

\item{n}{The length of the vector returned.}

\item{seed}{An integer value to pass to \code{\link[=set.seed]{set.seed()}}.}
}
\value{
A vector of standard normal recruitment deviations.
}
\description{
This function returns a set of pseudo-random recruitment deviations based
on an iteration number. Given the same iteration number the function will
return the same recruitment deviations. The deviations are standard normal.
I.e., they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
