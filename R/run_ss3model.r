#' Run an operating or estimation model in a directory
#'
#' Call Stock Synthesis to generate data or fit model to data.
#' The appropriate version of Stock Synthesis is called after determining if the
#' user is on Unix or Windows. This lower-level
#' function is meant to be called by higher level functions such as
#' [run_ss3sim()], [ss3sim_base()], or your own custom
#' function.
#'
#' @details ss3sim requires you to place the Stock Synthesis executable in your
#' path. See the vignette `vignette("introduction", package = "ss3sim")` for details on
#' this process. The executables themselves can be downloaded from github
#' \url{https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim/tree/master/inst/bin} or the
#' Stock Synthesis website
#' \url{https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/stock-synthesis/releases}.
#' If the github version of ss3sim is installed, rather than the CRAN version,
#' then the executables are automatically downloaded and called from their
#' stored location rather than from the path variable.
#' @template dir
#' @param hess Calculate the Hessian on estimation model runs?
#' @param admb_options Any additional options to pass to the Stock Synthesis command.
#' @param ignore.stdout Passed to `system`. If `TRUE` then ADMB
#'   output is not printed on screen. This will be slightly faster. Set to
#'   `FALSE` to help with debugging.
#' @param admb_pause A length of time (in seconds) to pause after running the
#'   simulation model. This can be necessary on certain computers where file
#'   writing can be slightly delayed. For example, on computers where the files
#'   are written over a network connection. If the output files haven't
#'   finished writing before \R starts looking for the output then the
#'   simulation will crash with an error about missing files. The default
#'   value is set to 0.01 seconds, just to be safe.
#' @param show.output.on.console Logical: passed on to [system()].
#' @param ... Anything else to pass to [system()].
#' @seealso [ss3sim_base()], [run_ss3sim()]

#' Rename Stock Synthesis version-specific files
#'
#' @details
#' Renaming the files from the name of the executable that was used plus the
#' relevant extension to Stock Synthesis plus the relevant extension allows users to use
#' any executable, such as ss_safe.exe. Renaming, particularly of the files
#' in the OM folder allows for other functions to expect ss.par instead of
#' random.par. This consistency is not as relevant now that we are using the
#' control file instead of the par file for most of the parameter manipulation.
#'
#' @param path The path to the folder with the files.
#' @param ss_bin A character value giving the Stock Synthesis binary name
#' @param extensions A character vector of file extensions to rename without
#'   periods preceding the values.
