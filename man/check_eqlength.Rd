\title{Check if input arguments have the same length}
\usage{
check_eqlength(..., keepgoing = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Input arguments of unknown length.}

\item{keepgoing}{A logical value specifying if the function
should continue or terminate upon finding input arguments of
non-equal length. The default, \code{FALSE}, produces an
error and terminates the function.}
}
\value{
\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} depending on the result
of the test. Nothing is returned if the stop function is invoked.
}
\description{
Calculate the length of all input arguments to see if they
are equal. Entries that are \code{NULL}, and thus, have
a length of zero are ignored. An optional trigger to
\code{\link[=stop]{stop()}} is provided with a tailored error message.
}
