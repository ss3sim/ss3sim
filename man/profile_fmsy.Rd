\usage{
profile_fmsy(
  om_in,
  results_out,
  start = 0,
  end = 1.5,
  by_val = 0.01,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{om_in}{A full or relative path to a directory that contains an
\pkg{ss3sim} operating model.}

\item{results_out}{A full or relative path to a directory where the results
will be saved. The directory will be created if it doesn't already exist.}

\item{start}{Lower fishing mortality levels that will be explored.}

\item{end}{Upper fishing mortality levels that will be explored.}

\item{by_val}{Interval at which F will be incremented between \code{start}
and \code{end}.}

\item{verbose}{When \code{TRUE} messages will be returned
from the function. Often useful for debugging. The default
is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Creates a plot and a table with catches and F values.
Also, invisibly returns a table of F and catch as a data frame.
}
\description{
Runs an operating model over a range of fishing mortality, \eqn{F}, levels to
determine the F at maximum sustainable yield, \eqn{F_{MSY}}.
}
\details{
This function extracts the number of years from the data
file and then runs the model with a constant level of fishing for each year,
extracting the catch in the last year. This assumes the length of the
model is long enough to reach an equilibrium catch. The user is
responsible for ensuring this fact. If the function is run with
\code{verbose = TRUE}, which is not the default, users will be provided
with coefficient of variations of the catches in the terminal years of
the model. Here, terminal is defined as half as many years as there are
ages in the population dynamics of your model.
Thus, if the population plus group starts at age twenty,
then the standard deviation of the last ten years of catch
divided by the mean catch over that same time will be printed to the
screen for each model that is ran. For the default cod model provided within
the package, the CV is less than 1e-04 for all F levels explored.

Ensure that the argument \code{om_in} leads to an operating model that is
configured for use within \pkg{ss3sim}. For example, the \eqn{F} type must
allow for an input vector of \eqn{Fs} rather than catches, along with other
specifications.
