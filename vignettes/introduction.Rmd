# Installing the ss3sim R package

ss3sim requires R version 3.1.0 or greater.
The package can be run on OS X, Windows, or Linux.
The CRAN version of ss3sim can be installed
in an R console with:

```{r, install-cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ss3sim")
```

The development version of ss3sim can be installed from GitHub
with the following code:

```{r, install-and-load, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") # if needed
devtools::install_github("ss3sim/ss3sim", dependencies = TRUE)

# If you would like the vignettes available with the GitHub development version:
devtools::install_github("ss3sim/ss3sim", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)

# If you would like to run simulations in parallel, also install:
install.packages(c("doParallel", "foreach"))
```

You can then load the package with:

```{r, load-package, eval=FALSE}
library("ss3sim")
```

You can read the help files and access the various vignettes (including this one) with:

```{r, help, eval=FALSE}
?ss3sim
help(package = "ss3sim")
browseVignettes("ss3sim")
```

See @anderson2014a for a more formal (but brief) overview of ss3sim.

We develop and test ss3sim around a specific version of SS3.
Currently, ss3sim is tested to work with SS3 Version 3.24O.
Since this is a more recent version than is provided at the normal download location
<http://nft.nefsc.noaa.gov/SS3.html>, we provide copies of the 3.24O
binaries (with the permission of R. Methot) at
<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zg0sec6j20sfyyz/AACQiuk787qW882U2euVKoPna>.

ss3sim requires the SS3 binary to be in your path.
This means that your operating system knows where the binary file is located.
See [the vignette section on paths](#path) for details.
See `?run_ss3model` for instructions on how to specify
the safe vs. the optimized binary.

Please direct any questions, suggestions, or bug reports to the ss3sim
issue tracker: <https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim/issues>, or to an
author as listed on the title page of this vignette.

If you use ss3sim in a publication, please cite the package as
indicated by running `citation("ss3sim")` in the R console:

```{r, citation, cache=FALSE}
citation("ss3sim")
```

# An overview of the ss3sim simulation structure

ss3sim is an R package to make it relatively quick and easy
to run simulations with the 3rd version of Stock Synthesis, SS3.
The package consists of a series of low-level functions
that facilitate manipulating SS3 configuration files,
running SS3 models, and combining the output.
ss3sim also contains some wrapper functions
that tie all these low-level functions together
into a complete simulation experiment.
If you choose to use our wrapper function `run_ss3sim`
then you will use a series of plain text control files
to control the simulation.
Much of this vignette focusses on
how to effectively use `run_ss3sim`,
but feel free to take the low-level functions
(`change` functions)
and use them as part of your own flexible simulation.

## Setting up the file structure

The ss3sim package is set up assuming there is
an established base-case operating model (OM) and estimation model (EM) to
work with. The ss3sim package comes with three generic built-in
model setups that can be used as is, modified, or replaced.
(For more details, see the [vignette on modifying these model setups](modifying-models.html) or the [vignette on creating your own OM and EMs](making-models.html)).
Each OM and EM should be in its own folder.
The OM folder should have the files:

```
yourOMmodel.ctl
yourOMmodel.dat
ss3.par
starter.ss
forecast.ss
```

The EM folder should have:

```
yourEMmodel.ctl
starter.ss
forecast.ss
```

In both cases, nothing more and nothing less.
The names of the `.ctl` and `.dat` files are not important.
The package functions will rename them after they are copied to appropriate folders.
These files should be derived from `.ss_new` files but with file
extensions as shown above.
It is important to use `.ss_new` files so the files have consistent
formatting.
Many of the functions in this package depend on that formatting.

To obtain `.ss_new` files,
open a command window in the OM and EM folders
and type `ss3` to run the models.
Once the model is finished running,
it will generate a number of files, including `.ss_new` files.
Remove the `.ss_new` file extension from the files needed
and add the appropriate file extension.

## Cases and scenarios {#case-parsing}

The high-level wrapper function `run_ss3sim`
uses unique case identifiers (IDs) that combine to create unique scenarios.
The types of cases are:
data quality (D), estimation (E), fishing mortality (F),
retrospective (R),
and any other letter describing a time varying case
(e.g. M for natural mortality, S for selectivity, or G for growth).
These case IDs are followed by an alphanumeric stock or species
identifier (e.g. `cod`).
The different versions of each case are identified with numbers.
For example, the base-case scenario for a cod stock might be:
`D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod`.
The order of the cases does not matter,
as long as they are used consistently.

ss3sim relies on a set of plain text files to control the simulation.
These plain text files are read by `get_caseval`
and turned into argument lists that are passed to `run_ss3sim`.
The function `create_argfiles` creates template input files.
It reads the various functions and parses the arguments and default values
into plain text files.
The default settings create these files:

1.  `E0-spp.txt` (for estimation method cases)

2.  `F0-spp.txt` (for fishing mortality cases)

3.  `R0-spp.txt` (for retrospective cases)

4.  `index0-spp.txt` (controlled by the `D` (data) case)

5.  `agecomp0-spp.txt` (controlled by the `D` (data) case)

6.  `lcomp0-spp.txt` (controlled by the `D` (data) case)

7.  `X0-spp.txt` (for a time-varying parameter X, where X could be any time-varying case letter)

![Illustration of input and output folder and file structure for an ss3sim simulation. Folders are shown in blue, input files in orange, and output files in grey. All input and output files are in plain text format. Case files (orange files at bottom left) combine cases (e.g. M0 for a given natural mortality trajectory) with species or life-history OMs and EMs (e.g. cod-like or sardine-like). Alternatively, a user can skip setting up case files and specify the simulation cases directly in R code (see [the vignette section on using ss3sim_base()](#ss3simbase)](filestructure.png)

After running `create_argfiles()`,
look in your working directory for the template input files.
(You can use `getwd()` to see your current working directory or
`setwd()` to set a different working directory.)
Change the case ID number (defaults to `0`)
and the species identifier to a three letter identifier.
For example, you might use `cod`, `sar`, or `fla`
for cod, sardine, or flatfish.
An example filename would therefore be
`M1-sar.txt` or `lcomp2-fla.txt`.
The case `D1` corresponds to the files
`index1-spp.txt`, `agecomp1-spp.txt`, and `lcomp0-spp.txt`.
The other case types have single argument files.

The first column in the text files
denotes the argument to be passed to a function.
The second argument denotes the value to be passed.
See the help for a `change` function
to see the arguments that need to be declared.
For example, see `?change_f`.

You can use any R syntax to declare argument values.
For example,
`c(1, 2, 4)`, or `seq(1, 100)`.
Character objects do not need to be quoted as long as they are one word,
but can be if you would like.
However, be careful not to use the delimiter (set up as a semicolon)
anywhere else in the file besides to denote columns.
You can add comments after any `#` symbol.

Putting that all together,
below is what an example `F1-cod.txt` file might look like:

     years; 1913:2012
     years_alter; 1913:2012
     fvals; c(rep(0, 25), rep(0.114, 75))

## Case file names

Function names and associated case files. Case file names are
given as the prefix. For example a case file for `sample_index`
might be `index0-cod.txt`.

ss3sim function              Case file name      Mandatory?
---------------              --------------      ----------
`change_f()`                 `F`                 Yes
`change_e()`                 `R`                 Yes
`sample_index()`             `index`             Yes
`sample_lcomp()`             `lcomp`             Yes
`sample_agecomp()`           `agecomp`           Yes
`change_tv()`                anything, see below No
`change_tail_compression()`  `tail_compression`  No
`change_lcomp_constant()`    `lcomp_constant`    No
`sample_calcomp()`           `calcomp`           No
`sample_wtatage()`           `wtatage`           No

`change_tv()` can take any other case file name, as long as the
first line is `function_type; change_tv`.

## Bias adjustment

Bias adjustment helps assure
that the estimated log-normally distributed recruitment deviations
are mean-unbiased leading to mean-unbiased estimates
of biomass [@methot2011].
The high-level wrapper function `run_ss3sim`
allows users to specify whether or not they would
like to use the bias adjustment routine built into the package
by setting the argument `bias_adjust` to `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
If `TRUE`, the function runs `bias_nsim` replicates
for each scenario (located in the subfolder `bias`
within a scenario folder) and then averages
the bias-adjustment parameter estimates.
The default number of bias-adjustment replicates is five.
If a bias-adjustment replicate fails to converge
(checked by identifying whether the Hessian was invertible),
the parameter estimates from that replicate are ignored.
A minimum threshold of 80% converged bias-adjustment replicates
(adjustable via the `conv_crit` argument)
is used to ensure reliable parameter estimates.
The mean bias adjustment runs are then used in the EM
for all subsequent "iterations"
(i.e. replicates using same models but different process and observation errors)
within that scenario.
We assume bias adjustment parameters applicable
to all iterations within the scenario are more likely
to be found by averaging across multiple sets of parameters.

The bias adjustment process creates several files in the `bias` folder
(for each scenario) which can be examined by the user. `AdjustBias.DAT`
contains the calculated adjustment parameters for each bias replicate, and
`AvgBias.DAT` contains the average of these estimates which are used in
all subsequent simulations for that scenario. Individual plots for each
successful bias adjustment replicate are also created.
If `bias_adjust` is set to `FALSE`,
no bias adjustment replicates are executed and no bias adjustment is performed.

## Output file structure

Internally, the function `copy_ss3models` creates a folder structure
and copies the operating and estimation models.
The folder structure looks like:

      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/1/om
      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/1/em
      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/2/om
      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/2/em
      ...

The integer values after the scenario ID represent different iterations; the total
number of iterations run are specified by the user. If you are using bias
adjustment (`bias_adjust = TRUE`) then there will be some additional
folders.  In that case the folders will look like:

      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/bias/1/om
      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/bias/1/em
      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/bias/2/om
      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/bias/2/em
      ...
      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/1/om
      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/1/em
      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/2/om
      D0-E0-F0-M0-R0-cod/2/em
      ...

Note that the OM and EM folders will be renamed
`om` and `em` within each iteration,
the OM and EM are checked
to make sure they contain the minimal files ([as listed above](#case-parsing)),
the filenames will be all lowercase,
the data file is renamed `ss3.dat`,
the control files are renamed `om.ctl` or `em.ctl`,
and the starter and control files are adjusted
to reflect these new file names.
The functions in this package
assume you have set your working directory in R
to be the base folder where you will store the scenario folders.

# An example simulation with ss3sim {#example}

As an example, we will run a 2x2 simulation design in which we test
(1) the effect of high and low precision on the index of abundance research survey and
(2) the effect of fixing versus estimating natural mortality (*M*).
All of the required files for this example are contained
within the ss3sim package.
To start, we will locate three sets of folders:
the folder with the plain text case files,
the folder with the OM,
and the folder with the EM.

```{r, locate-folders}
library(ss3sim)
d <- system.file("extdata", package = "ss3sim")
case_folder <- paste0(d, "/eg-cases")
om <- paste0(d, "/models/cod-om")
em <- paste0(d, "/models/cod-em")
```

See the folder `ss3sim/inst/extdata/eg-cases`
inside the ss3sim source code
for all the case files that are used in this example simulation.
You can either download the source code
from <https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim>
or find this folder at the location contained
in the `case_folder` object defined
in the block of R code above this paragraph.

## Creating the case files

We will base the simulation around the base-case files created
for a cod-like species in the papers
@ono2014 and @johnson2014,
both of which used the ss3sim package.
You can refer to these papers for details on how the models were set up.

If we were starting from scratch,
we would run the function `create_argfiles()`,
which would create a default set of configuration files
in our R working directory.
Instead we will start with the configuration files from those papers.

To investigate the effect of different levels of precision on the survey index of abundance,
we will manipulate the argument `sds_obs`
that gets passed to `sample_index`.
This argument ultimately refers to the standard error
on the log(index) value, as defined in SS3.
In case 0, we will specify the standard deviation at 0.1
and in case 1 we will increase the standard deviation to 0.4.
We can do this by including the line: `sds_obs; 0.1`
in the file `D0-cod.txt` and the line: `sds_obs; 0.4`
in the file `D1-cod.txt`.

The file `index0-cod.txt` will therefore look like:

    fleets;  2
    years;   list(seq(1974, 2012, by = 2))
    sds_obs; list(0.1)

`fleets` refers to the fleet number we want to sample from (as defined in
the model), `2` in
`codOM.dat` refers to the survey fleet. We then run our survey from
1974 to 2012 with a standard error on the log(survey index) of 0.1.

We will not describe the length or age composition sampling here in detail, but
you can refer to the help files `?sample_lcomp` and
`?sample_agecomp` along with the case files included in the package
data. Also see [vignette section](#comps) where we describe the theory behind the
age- and length-composition sampling in ss3sim.

To investigate the effect of fixing versus estimating *M*,
we will manipulate the argument `natM_val` that gets passed to `change_e`.
The first entry of `natM_val` is the value which *M* is fixed or
initialized at and the second refers the phase.
In case 0, we will set the phase in which *M* is estimated
to `-1` (any negative phase number will tell SS3
to not estimate a particular parameter)
and use the argument `NA`
to fix *M* at the true value (i.e. do not modify it from what is in the
EM `.ctl` file).
In case 1, we will estimate *M* in
phase `3` and initialize the estimation of *M* at `0.20`.
We can do this by including the line: `natM_val; c(NA, -1)`
in the file `E0-cod.txt`
and the line: `natM_val; c(0.20, 3)` in the file `E1-cod.txt`.
This means that case `E1` will initialize *M* at `0.20`
and estimate *M* in the third phase.
For example, the complete case file `E0-cod.txt` is:

    natM_type;          1Parm
    natM_n_breakpoints; NULL
    natM_lorenzen;      NULL
    natM_val;           c(NA,-1)
    par_name;           LnQ_base_3_CPUE
    par_int;            NA
    par_phase;          -1
    forecast_num;       0

Since we will not be running a retrospective analysis
in this example, this will be our `R0-cod.txt` file:

     retro_yr; 0

We will set the fishing mortality $F$ to a constant level
at $F_\mathrm{MSY}$ ($F$ at maximum sustainable yield)
from when the fishery starts (in year 25)
until the end of our simulation (year 100).
Therefore, this is our `F0-cod.txt`:

    years;       1913:2012
    years_alter; 1913:2012
    fvals;       c(rep(0,25), rep(0.114,75))

Although we do not have any time-varying processes in this example simulation,
we include `M` case files
in which we describe *M* as stationary (`M0-cod.txt`):

    function_type; change_tv
    param;         NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1
    dev;           rep(0, 100)

Simply by changing the deviations from a vector of zeros
to any vector pattern of deviations,
we could add time-varying *M*.
In a [later vignette section]((#time-varying)
we describe how time-varying parameters are
unique in ss3sim and how you can make any parameter
described in SS3 time varying using this approach.

## Checking the case files

It is a good idea to check that the case files
are manipulating the SS3 model files as intended.
One way we can do this is by
running the `change` functions directly on the SS3 model files
using the arguments specified within the case files
and inspecting the modified SS3 files.
Another way is to run a single iteration of your simulation
through `run_ss3sim`
and carefully inspect the OM and EM model files that it creates.
For example, we could run:

```{r, case-file-checks, eval=FALSE}
run_ss3sim(iterations = 1, scenarios =
  c("D0-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D1-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D0-E1-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D1-E1-F0-R0-M0-cod"),
  case_folder = case_folder, om_dir = om,
  em_dir = em)
```

And then check the SS3 files that are created.

## Self testing: deterministic simulations to check the models for bias {#deterministic}

Self testing is a crucial step of any simulation study.
One way to accomplish this is to set up an EM that is similar to the OM
and include minimal error.

We will run some simulations to check our EM for bias when process and
observation error are minimized.
To do this, we will start by setting up a 100 row (number of years) by 20 column
(number of iterations) matrix of recruitment deviations, where all values are
set to zero.

```{r, }
recdevs_det <- matrix(0, nrow = 100, ncol = 20)
```

Then we will set up case “estimation” files in which the
initialized values of the recruitment deviation
standard deviations, `SR_sigmaR`,
are set to the nominal level of `0.001`.
We will name these files `E100-cod.txt` and `E101-cod.txt`.
In the case files, the key element is setting
`par_name = SR_sigmaR` (the SS3 parameter name) and `par_int = 0.001` (the initial value).
The arguments `par_name` and `par_int` are set up
to handle vectors of parameter names and values.
In this example, changing
`SR_sigmaR` will be the second parameter in the vector.
Again, you can look at all the case files in the package folder `/inst/extdata/eg-cases/`.
As an example, here is the file `E101-cod`:

    natM_type;          1Parm
    natM_n_breakpoints; NULL
    natM_lorenzen;      NULL
    natM_val;           c(0.20,3)
    par_name;           LnQ_base_3_CPUE,SR_sigmaR
    par_int;            c(NA,0.001)
    par_phase;          c(-1,-1)
    forecast_num;       0

To minimize observation error on the survey index,
we will create a data case 100
that has a standard deviation on the survey observation error of 0.001.
Therefore, our case file `index100-cod.txt` will look like this:

    fleets;  2
    years;   list(seq(1974, 2012, by = 2))
    sds_obs; list(0.001)

When we run the simulations,
we will pass our deterministic recruitment deviations
to the function `run_ss3sim`.
Running 20 iterations should be enough
to identify whether our models are performing as we expect.
Note that by default 5 bias adjustment runs are performed since we specify that
`bias_adjust=TRUE`.

```{r, deterministic-runs, eval=FALSE}
run_ss3sim(iterations = 1:20,
  scenarios = c("D100-E100-F0-R0-M0-cod", "D100-E101-F0-R0-M0-cod"),
  case_folder = case_folder, om_dir = om, em_dir = em,
  bias_adjust = TRUE, user_recdevs = recdevs_det)
```

We have written out the scenario names in full for clarity,
but ss3sim also contains
a convenience function `expand_scenarios`.
With this function we could instead write:

```{r, deterministic-runs-expand, eval=FALSE}
x <- expand_scenarios(list(D = 100, E = 100:101, F = 0, M = 0,
    R = 0), species = "cod")
run_ss3sim(iterations = 1:20, scenarios = x,
  case_folder = case_folder, om_dir = om, em_dir = em,
  bias_adjust = TRUE, user_recdevs = recdevs_det)
```

Note that due to the way that SS3 is being used as an operating model,
you may see an ADMB error in the console:

    Error -- base = 0 in function prevariable& pow(const prevariable& v1,
      CGNU_DOUBLE u)

However, this is not a problem since ADMB is not used to optimize the OM — the
error can safely be ignored.

## Running the stochastic simulations

The package contains a set of normally-distributed recruitment deviations,
with a mean of `-0.5` and a standard deviation of `1`
(bias-corrected standard-normal deviations).
To use the pre-specified deviations
remove the argument `user_recdevs` from `run_ss3sim`.
Process error will now be unique for each iteration but consistent across scenarios
for a specific iteration, to facilitate comparison between scenarios.

We will only run 100 iterations here to save time
and keep the package size down,
but in a real simulation testing study
you may want to run many more iterations, perhaps testing
how many iterations are required before the key results stabilize.

```{r, stochastic-runs, eval=FALSE}
run_ss3sim(iterations = 1:100, scenarios =
  c("D0-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D1-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D0-E1-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D1-E1-F0-R0-M0-cod"),
  case_folder = case_folder, om_dir = om,
  em_dir = em, bias_adjust = TRUE)
```

## Reading in the output and plotting the results

The function `get_results_all` reads in a set of scenarios

and combines the output into two `.csv` files:
`ss3sim_scalar.csv` and `ss3sim_ts.csv`. The `scalar` file
contains values for which there is a single estimated value (e.g. MSY) and the `ts`
file refers to values for which there are time series of estimates available (e.g. biomass
for each year). The column names refer to the output from SS3, so it
can be useful to consult the SS3 manual for details.

```{r, get-results, eval=FALSE}
get_results_all(user_scenarios =
  c("D100-E100-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D100-E101-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D0-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D1-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D0-E1-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D1-E1-F0-R0-M0-cod"))
```

We will read in the `.csv` files:

```{r, read-output, eval=FALSE}
scalar_dat <- read.csv("ss3sim_scalar.csv")
ts_dat <- read.csv("ss3sim_ts.csv")
```

Or if you would like to follow along with the rest of the vignette
without running the simulations above,
you can load a saved version of the output:

```{r, load-output}
data("ts_dat", package = "ss3sim")
data("scalar_dat", package = "ss3sim")
```

First, we will calculate some useful values in new columns and separate the
deterministic from the stochastic simulation runs:

```{r, transform-output}
scalar_dat <- transform(scalar_dat,
  steep = (SR_BH_steep_om - SR_BH_steep_em)/SR_BH_steep_om,
  logR0 = (SR_LN_R0_om - SR_LN_R0_em)/SR_LN_R0_om,
  depletion = (depletion_om - depletion_em)/depletion_om,
  SSB_MSY = (SSB_MSY_em - SSB_MSY_om)/SSB_MSY_om,

ts_dat <- transform(ts_dat,
  SpawnBio = (SpawnBio_em - SpawnBio_om)/SpawnBio_om,
  Recruit_0 = (Recruit_0_em - Recruit_0_om)/Recruit_0_om)
ts_dat <- merge(ts_dat, scalar_dat[,c("scenario", "replicate",
    "max_grad")])

scalar_dat_det <- subset(scalar_dat, E %in% c("E100", "E101"))
scalar_dat_sto <- subset(scalar_dat, E %in% c("E0", "E1"))
ts_dat_det <- subset(ts_dat, E %in% c("E100", "E101"))
ts_dat_sto <- subset(ts_dat, E %in% c("E0", "E1"))
```

Now we will turn the scalar data into long-data format so we can make a
multipanel plot with the R package ggplot2.

```{r, reshape-scalars}
scalar_dat_long <- reshape2::melt(scalar_dat[,c("scenario", "D", "E",
  "replicate", "max_grad", "steep", "logR0", "depletion", "SSB_MSY",
  "SR_sigmaR", "NatM")], id.vars = c("scenario", "D", "E",
  "replicate", "max_grad"))
scalar_dat_long <- plyr::rename(scalar_dat_long,
  c("value" = "relative_error"))
```

Now we can create boxplots of the deterministic model runs. The following code produces Figure~\ref{fig:relative-error-boxplots-det}.

```{r, relative-error-boxplots-det, fig.height=7, fig.width=5, fig.cap="Relative error box plots for deterministic runs. In case E100, *M* is fixed at the true value; in E101 we estimate *M*. In case D100, the standard deviation on the survey index observation error is 0.001."}
library("ggplot2")
p <- ggplot(subset(scalar_dat_long, E %in% c("E100", "E101") &
       variable != "SR_sigmaR"), aes(D, relative_error)) +
     geom_boxplot() +
     geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), lty = 2) +
     facet_grid(variable~E) +
     theme_bw() + ylim(-0.4, 0.4)
print(p)
```

Let's look at the relative error in estimates of spawning biomass.
We will colour the time series according to the maximum gradient.
Small values of the maximum gradient (approximately 0.001 or less)
indicate that model convergence is likely.
Larger values (greater than 1) indicate that model convergence is unlikely.
Results of individual iterations are jittered around the vertical axis
to aid in visualization.
The following three blocks of code produce
Figures~\ref{fig:plot-sto-ts}, \ref{fig:ssb-ts-plots},
and \ref{fig:relative-error-boxplots-sto}.

```{r, plot-sto-ts, fig.height=5, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Time series of relative error in spawning stock biomass."}
p <- ggplot(ts_dat_sto, aes(x = year)) + xlab("Year") +
    theme_bw() + geom_line(aes(y = SpawnBio, group = replicate,

# Using ss3sim_base directly {#ss3simbase}

An alternative approach to using ss3sim is to skip
setting up the case files
and use `ss3sim_base` directly
by passing lists of arguments.
The lists correspond to the arguments
to each of the `change` or `sample` functions
without any references to the files that need to be modified.
(Although if you passed the file names they would just be ignored.)
The documentation for each function includes an asterisk
beside the arguments that you can specify.
Note that if you do not include an argument then `ss3sim_base`
will assume the value of that argument is `NULL`.

When we call `ss3sim_base` directly,
the scenario ID only serves the function
of identifying the output folder name
and could technically be any character string.
For example,
we could have run the scenario `D1-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod`
that we ran before:

```{r, ss3sim-base-eg, eval=FALSE}
d <- system.file("extdata", package = "ss3sim")
om <- paste0(d, "/models/cod-om")
em <- paste0(d, "/models/cod-em")

F0 <- list(years = 1913:2012, years_alter = 1913:2012, fvals =
  c(rep(0, 25), rep(0.114, 75)))

index1 <- list(fleets = 2, years = list(seq(1974, 2012, by = 2)),
  sds_obs = list(0.1))

lcomp1 <- list(fleets = c(1, 2), Nsamp = list(100, 100), years =
  list(1938:2012, seq(1974, 2012, by = 2)), lengthbin_vector = NULL,
  cpar = c(1, 1))

agecomp1 <- list(fleets = c(1, 2), Nsamp = list(100, 100), years =
  list(1938:2012, seq(1974, 2012, by = 2)), agebin_vector = NULL,
  cpar = c(1, 1))

E0 <- list(natM_type = "1Parm", natM_n_breakpoints = NULL,
  natM_lorenzen = NULL, natM_val = c(NA,-1), par_name =
  "LnQ_base_3_CPUE", par_int = NA, par_phase = -1, forecast_num = 0)

M0 <- list(NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1 = rep(0, 100))

R0 <- list(retro_yr = 0)

ss3sim_base(iterations = 1:20, scenarios = "D1-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
  f_params = F0, index_params = index1, lcomp_params = lcomp1,
  agecomp_params = agecomp1, estim_params = E0, tv_params = M0,
  retro_params = R0, om_dir = om, em_dir = em)
```

# An example of customizing the case specifications

You do not need to stick with the scenario ID scheme laid out
by default in ss3sim.
You are free to choose your own scheme by adjusting the list
of values passed to the `case_files` argument
in `run_ss3sim()`.

Below is an example where we'll specify the arguments to the
sampling functions via their own case files. We'll arbitrarily call these
cases X, Y, and Z.

We will start by copying over some case arguments built into the package.
We will copy what was called
`index0-cod.txt`, `lcomp0-cod.txt`, and `agecomp0-cod.txt`
into `X-cod.txt`, `Y-cod.txt`, and `Z-cod.txt`.
Then we’ll set up our custom `case_files` list and call `run_ss3sim()`:

```{r, alternative-case-lists, eval=FALSE}
case_folder <- system.file("extdata", "eg-cases", package = "ss3sim")
om <- system.file("extdata", "models/cod-om", package = "ss3sim")
em <- system.file("extdata", "models/cod-em", package = "ss3sim")
files <- list.files(case_folder, pattern = "0-cod")

temp_case_folder <- "ss3sim-example-cases"
dir.create(temp_case_folder)
file.copy(paste0(case_folder, "/", files), temp_case_folder)

# now make X, Y, and Z case files:
setwd(temp_case_folder)
file.copy("index0-cod.txt", "X0-cod.txt")
file.copy("lcomp0-cod.txt", "Y0-cod.txt")
file.copy("agecomp0-cod.txt", "Z0-cod.txt")
setwd("..")

# our custom specification:
case_files <- list(M = "M", F = "F", R = "R", E = "E",
  X = "index", Y = "lcomp", Z = "agecomp")

# and use run_ss3sim() with our new case_file list:
run_ss3sim(iterations = 1,
  scenarios = "X0-Y0-Z0-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
  case_folder = temp_case_folder,
  om_dir = om, em_dir = em,
  case_files = case_files)
```


# Time-varying parameters in the OM {#time-varying}

The ss3sim package includes the capability for inducing time-varying
changes in parameters in the OM. The package currently does not have built-in
functions to turn on/off the estimation of time-varying parameters, so this
cannot be done with case arguments. However, it is possible to create versions
of an EM with and without time-varying estimation of a parameter. This approach
would allow for testing of differences between estimating a single, constant
parameter, vs.\ a time-varying estimate.

You can specify any parameter defined in your  OM model
as time varying through the `change_tv` function.
The function works by adding an environmental deviate ($env$)
to the base parameter ($par$),
creating a time varying parameter ($par'$) for each year ($y$),
\begin{equation}
par'_y = par + link * env_y.
\end{equation}
The $link$ is pre-specified to a value of one and
$par$ is the base value for the given parameter,
as defined in the `.par` file.
For all catchability parameters (*q*), the deviate will be added to the
log transform of the base parameter using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
  \log(q'_{y}) = \log(q) + link * env_{y}.
\end{equation}
The vector of deviates must contain one value for every year of the simulation
and can be specified as zero for years in which the parameter does not deviate
from the base parameter value.

Currently, `change_tv` function
only works to add time-varying properties
to a time-invariant parameter.
It cannot alter the properties of parameters that already vary with time.
Also, it will not work with custom environmental linkages.
Environmental linkages for all parameters in the OM
must be declared by a single line
i.e. `0 #_custom_mg-env_setup (0/1)`
prior to using `change_tv`.
Additionally, SS3 does not allow more than one stock recruit parameter
to vary with time. Therefore, if the `.ctl` file already has a
stock recruit parameter that varies with time and you try to implement another,
the function will fail.

Since the `change_tv` function can be used for a number of
purposes, it interacts differently with the case files than the other
`change` functions.
To pass arguments to `change_tv` through
`run_ss3sim` you need to:
(1) create a case file with an arbitrary letter
not used elsewhere (i.e. anything but D, E, F, or R) and
(2) include the line:

    function_type; change_tv

in your case file. For example,
you might want to use M for natural mortality, S for selectivity,
or G for growth.

# Incorporating a new case ID

ss3sim is designed with a set of mandatory case IDs that must be
specified for each run: data (`D`), estimation (`E`), fishing
effort (`F`),and retrospective (R).
Also, by default, `run_ss3sim` is set up to require a natural mortality
(`M`) case.
In many instances a user may wish to include a new case ID.
This section is designed to explain how to accomplish
this within the ss3sim framework. Note that as currently developed,
ss3sim incorporates all new cases by using the `change_tv`
function, even if the changes are not time-varying. However, you can simply pass
a constant vector of values to induce a constant change in a parameter.

As an example, you might want to incorporate changes in selectivity
(time-varying or not) in the OM to more accurately mimic the behaviour of a real
fishery. Using the help file for `change_tv`, we can create a set of "S"
(for selectivity) case argument files which contain the changes required. You
may choose to only have a "base case" which applies to all scenarios in the simulation
test, or you may have multiple cases to investigate how different patterns of
selectivity in the OM affect the EM. Now that the case argument files have been
created, you need to tell ss3sim to use them, since they are outside of
the mandatory set. This is done through the `case_files` argument in the
`get_caseargs` function, which is passed through by the
`run_ss3sim`. In this case, we need to tell it to look for
case argument files beginning with "S"
(see the help file for `get_caseargs` for more information):

```{r, custom-case-eg, eval=FALSE}
case_files = list(E = "E", D = c("index", "lcomp", "agecomp"),
  F = "F", M = "M", R = "R", S = "S")
```
Note that `S` is simply added to the end of the default list of case IDs.

Note that the data case ID is a special case because its case argument files do not
begin with `D`. This is because there are three functions associated with
the data case, independently modifying three different parts of the
`.dat` file.

This provides a template for how you could incorporate
multiple changes to selectivity (for example) through different functions (which you would
need to write yourself). For example, you may want to add time-varying
deviations to multiple parameters in the selectivity setup of the OM. You could
then create functions that modify selectivity in different ways, and pass them
the same way the `D` case is handled above.

We recommend verifying the
functionality of any new cases by: (1) thoroughly verifying that your R
functions work outside of ss3sim, and then (2) running a single
iteration and manually checking the produced files. If you write external
functions for manipulating new aspects of SS3 models, please contact the
ss3sim package developers for potential inclusion in future versions.

# Adjusting the available OM data dynamically {#change-data}

ss3sim can dynamically adjust the type of data available
from the OM for sampling.
For example, you might wish to sample conditional length-at-age
in a certain bin structure for certain years and fleets.
To do that, the OM will need to generate length and age data
for appropriate years and fleets at a sufficiently fine bin size.
However, the idea behind ss3sim is to avoid having to hand code
many different versions of an SS3 OM that have only minor differences.
One way around this would be to write an OM that included
all possible data types for all possible years
at an extremely fine bin structure.
But, this can substantially slow down how quickly the OM runs in SS3.
Therefore, we made ss3sim capable
of dynamically modifying the OM to include
just the data types and quantities that are needed
based on arguments that are
passed to the sampling functions (e.g. `sample_agecomp`).
Internally, ss3sim uses the function `calculate_data_units`
to generate a superset of all necessary fleet and year combinations.
See [the section below](#obs-error) for more information on these types
of data.

The dynamic creation of available data is the default behavior of the
package. In practice this means the user does not need to manage which data
types, fleets, or years are produced by the OM. However, in some cases the
user may wish to disable this behavior and there is a top-level argument
available in `ss3sim_base` called `call_change_data`
(default of `TRUE`). For example, in some cases it may be more
beneficial to call `change_data` before the simulation to manually
prepare the OM data file, which will then be available for all subsequent EMs.
Dynamic OM data creation would then be unnecessary.

In the default case of dynamic data creation, we apply the following rules
if the arguments to any sampling function are not `NULL`:

- If `sample_agecomp`, generate age-composition data
- If `sample_lencomp`, generate length-composition data
- If `sample_mlacomp`, generate age-composition data and mean length-at-age data
- If `sample_calcomp`, generate length- and age-composition data and conditional length-at-age data
- If `sample_wtatage`, generate empirical weight-at-age, age-composition, and mean length-at-age data

For instance, if empirical weight-at-age data are to be sampled
(`sample_wtatage` is called in a scenario), `change_data`
adds age composition and mean length-at-age data to the model.

Another feature of `change_data` is that it can also modify the
binning structure of the data (not the population-level bins). The ages and
lengths in the data are specified in the arguments `len_bin` and
`age_bin` in `ss3sim_base`. These bins need to be
consistent across the entire data file for SS3 to
operate. (Empirical weight-at-age data are a special case because they
are generated in a separate file and use the population bins)
Also, when either of these are set to `NULL` (the default value) then
the respective bins are taken from the original OM (i.e. be left unchanged).

# Generating observation error {#obs-error}

Simulated data arising from sampling the "truth" (i.e. observations),
can be added within the ss3sim framework automatically and
dynamically. Currently ss3sim supports five types of data: indices of
abundance, length and age compositions, mean length (size) at age,
empirical weight at age, and conditional age at length.  Functions generate
these data using the truth from the OM `.dat` files, and create the
input `.dat` files for the EM. Since this sampling process is done
dynamically with functions there is a lot of flexibility that can be added
by the user.

This section briefly details the background and functionality of these
"sampling" functions. Note that the years/fleets to be sampled must be
present in the OM output data file. [ss3sim does this data creation
dynamically but in some cases it may need to be done manually](#change-data).

In simulation work, the true underlying dynamics of the population are
known and therefore a variety of sampling techniques are possible. For
instance ideal sampling (in the statistical sense) can be done easily.
However, there is some question about the realism behind providing the
model with this kind of data, since it is unlikely to happen in practice
[@pennington2002]. Thus, there is a need to be able to generate more
realistic data.  In ss3sim we can accomplish this in several
ways. One way is to use flexible distributions which allow the user to
control the statistical properties (e.g. overdispersion) of the data.

For example, consider simulating age composition data.  Under perfect
mixing of fish and truly random sampling of the population, the samples
would be multinomial.  However, in practice neither of these are true
because the fish tend to aggregate by size and age, and it is difficult to
take random samples [e.g. @pennington2002]. This causes the data
to have more variance than expected, i.e. be overdispersed, and the
effective sample size is smaller [@hulson2012; @maunder2011]. For
example, if a multinomial likelihood is assumed for overdispersed data, the
model puts too much weight on those data, at the cost of fitting other data
less well [@maunder2011]. Analysts thus often "tune" their model to
find a more appropriate sample size (called "effective sample size") that
(hopefully) more accurately reflects the information in the composition
data. In our case, we exactly control how the data are generated and
specified in the EM — providing a large amount of flexibility to the
user. What is optimal will depend on the questions addressed by a
simulation and how the results are meant to be interpreted. We caution
users to carefully consider how data are generated and fit in an
ss3sim simulation.

Below we summarize the types of data currently incorporated into the
package, how sampling is done, and how effective sample sizes are dealt
with.

## Indices of abundance

The function `sample_index` facilitates generating relative
indices of abundance (CPUE for fishery fleets). It samples from the
biomass trends for the different fleets to simulate the collection of CPUE
and survey index data. The user can specify which fleets are sampled in
which years and with what amount of noise. Different fleets will "see"
different biomass trends due to differences in selectivity, so each index
is associated with the same fleet between the OM and EM. Since $q=1$ for
the OM, the indices are actually absolute indices of (spawning) biomass.

In practice, sampling from the abundance indices is relatively
straightforward. The OM `.dat` file contains the annual biomass
values for each fleet, and the `sample_index` function uses these
true values as the mean of a distribution. The function uses a
bias-corrected log-normal distribution with expected values given by the OM
biomass and a user-provided standard deviation term that controls the level
of variance.

More specifically, let
\begin{align*}
  B_y&=\text{the true (OM) biomass in year $y$}\\
  \sigma_y&=\text{the standard deviation provided by the user}\\
  X\sim N(0, \sigma_y^2)&=\text{a normal random variable}
\end{align*}
Then the sampled value, $B_y^\text{obs}$ is
\begin{equation*}
  B_y^\text{obs}=B_y e^{X-\sigma_y^2/2}
\end{equation*}
which has expected value $\Eof{B_y^\text{obs}}=B_y$ due to the bias adjustment
term $\sigma_y^2/2$ (`SR_sigmaR` in SS3). This process generates
log-normal values centered at the true value. It is possible for the user to
specify the amount of uncertainty (e.g.\ to mimic the amount of survey effort),
but it is not possible to induce bias in this process (as currently
implemented).

## Effective sample size

For index data, which are assumed log-normal by SS3, the weight of the data
is determined by the CV of each point. As the CV increases the data have
less weight in the joint likelihood. This is equivalent to decreasing the
effective sample size in other distributions. ss3sim sets these
values automatically at the truth internally, although future versions may
allow for more complex options. The user-supplied $\sigma_y$ term is
written to the `.dat` file along with the sampled values, so that
the EM has the correct level of uncertainty. Thus, the EM has unbiased
estimates of both $B_y$ and the true $\sigma_y$ for all fleets.

## Age and length compositions {#comps}

The functions `sample_agecomp` and `sample_lcomp` sample
from the true age and length compositions using a multinomial or Dirichlet
distribution. The user can further specify which fleets are sampled in
which years and with what amount of noise (via sample size).

The following calculations demonstrate how ss3sim handles
compositional data. They are shown for age compositions but apply equally
to length compositions. The multinomial distribution $\mathbf{m} \sim
\text{MN}\left(\mathbf{p}, n, A\right )$ is defined as
\begin{align*} \mathbf{m} &= m_1, \ldots, m_A\\
  &=\text{the number of fish observed in bin $a$}\\
  \mathbf{p}&= p_1, \ldots, p_A\\
  &=\text{the true proportion of fish in bin $a$}\\
  n&=\text{sample size} \\
  A&=\text{number of age bins}
\end{align*}
In the case of SS3, actual proportions are input as data so $\mathbf{m}/n$
is the distribution used instead of $\mathbf{m}$. Thus, the variance of
the estimated proportion for age bin $a$ is $\Vof{M_a/n}=p_aq_a/n$. Note
that $m_a/n$ can only take on values in the set $\{0, 1/n, 2/n, \ldots,
1\}$. With sufficiently large sample size this set approximates the real
interval $[0,1]$, but the key point being that only a finite set of
rational values of $m_a/n$ are possible.

The multinomial, as described above, is based on assumptions of ideal
sampling and is likely unrealistic. One strategy to add realism is to allow
for overdispersion.

### Sampling with overdispersion

The composition sampling functions provided in the package allow the user
to specify the level of overdispersion through the argument `cpar`.
However, the package does not currently allow for specifying the effective
sample size. See the function documentation for `sample_agecomp`
and `sample_lcomp` for more detail.

Here we describe the implementation of the Dirichlet distribution utilized
in the package. This distribution has the same range and mean, but a
different variance controlled by a parameter (the variance is determined
exclusively by the cell probabilities in the multinomial) and as such is
more flexible. Let $\mathbf{d} \sim \text{Dirichlet}\left
  (\boldsymbol{\alpha}, A\right )$ be a Dirichlet random vector. It is
characterized by:
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{d} &= d_1, \ldots, d_A\\
  &=\text{the proportion of fish observed in bin $a$}\\
  \boldsymbol{\alpha}&= \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_A\\
  &=\text{concentration parameters for the proportion of fish in bin $a$}\\
  A&=\text{number of age bins}
\end{align*}

Since we are using the Dirichlet distribution to generate random samples,
it is convenient to parameterize the vector of concentration parameters
$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ as $\lambda \mathbf{p}$
so that $\alpha_a=\lambda p_a$.
The mean of $d_a$ is then $\Eof{d_a}=p_a$ and the variance is
$\Vof{d_a}=\frac{p_aq_a}{\lambda+1}$.
The marginal distributions for the Dirichlet are beta distributed.
In contrast to the multinomial above,
the Dirichlet generates points on the real interval $[0,1]$.

The following steps are used to generate overdispersed samples:

- Get the true proportions at age
  (from the operating model "truth")
  for the number of age bins $A$.
- Determine a realistic sample size, say $n=100$.
  Calculate the variance of the samples
  from a multinomial distribution, call it $V_{m_a}$.
- Specify a level, $c$, that scales the standard deviation
  of the multinomial.
  Then $\sqrt{V_{d_{a}}}=c\sqrt{V_{m_{a}}}$
  from which $\lambda=n/c^2-1$ can be solved.
  Samples from the Dirichlet with this value of $\lambda$
  will then give the appropriate level of variance.
  For instance, we can generate samples
  with twice the standard deviation of the multinomial by setting $c=2$.

### Effective sample sizes

For both multinomial and Dirichlet generated composition data the effective
sample size is set automatically by the `sample_lcomp` and
`sample_agecomp` functions. In the case of the multinomial the
effective sample size is just the total sample size (i.e.\ how many fish
were sampled, the number of sampled tows, etc.). However, with the
Dirichlet distribution the effective sample size depends on the parameters
passed to these functions and is automatically calculated internally and
passed on to the `.dat` file. The effective sample size is
calculated as $N_{eff}=n/c^2$. Note that these values will not necessarily
be integer-valued, and SS3 handles this without issue.

Given that the effective sample size is known and passed to the EM, there
is much similarity between the multinomial and Dirichlet methods for
generating data. The main difference arises when sample sizes ($n$) are
small; in this case the multinomial will be restricted to few potential
values (i.e. $0/n, 1/n, \ldots, n/n$), whereas the Dirichlet has values in
$[0,1]$. Thus without the Dirichlet it would be impossible to generate
realistic values that would come about from highly overdispersed data with
a large $n$.

# Generating process error {#pro-error}

Process error is incorporated into the OM in the form of deviates in
recruitment ("recdevs") from the stock-recruit relationship. Unlike the
observation error, the process error affects the population dynamics
and thus must be done before running the OM.

These built-in recruitment
deviations are standard normal deviates and are multiplied by
$\sigma_r$ (recruitment standard deviation) as specified in the OM,
and bias adjusted within the package. That is,
\begin{equation*}
  \text{recdev}_i=\sigma_r z_i-\sigma_r^2/2
\end{equation*}
where $z_i$ is a standard normal deviate and the bias adjustment term
($\sigma_r^2/2$) makes the deviates have an expected value of 1 after
exponentiation.

If the recruitment deviations are not specified,
then the package will use these built-in
recruitment deviations. Alternatively you can specify your own
recruitment deviations, via the argument `user_recdevs` to the
top-level function `ss3sim_base`. Ensure that you pass a matrix
with at least enough columns (iterations) and rows (years). The
user-supplied recruitment deviations are used exactly as specified
(i.e. not multiplied by $\sigma_r$ as specified in the SS3 model),
and **it is up to you to bias correct them manually** by
subtracting $\sigma_r^2 / 2$ as is done above. This functionality
allows for flexibility in how the recruitment deviations are
specified, for example [running deterministic runs](#deterministic) 
or adding serial correlation.

Note that for both built-in and user-specified recdevs ss3sim
will reuse the same set of recruitment deviations for all iterations
across scenarios. For example if you have two scenarios and run 100
iterations of each, the same set of recruitment deviations are used
between those two scenarios.

# Stochastic reproducibility {#reproduce}

In many cases, you may want to make
the observation and process error reproducible.
For instance, you may want to reuse process error
so that differences between scenarios
are not confounded with process error.
More broadly, you may want to make a simulation reproducible
on another machine by another user (such as a reviewer).

By default ss3sim sets a seed based on the iteration number.
This will create the same recruitment deviations for a given iteration number.
You can therefore avoid having the same recruitment deviations for a given iteration number
by either specifying your own recruitment deviation matrix
through the `user_recdevs` argument
or by changing the iteration numbers
(e.g. using iterations 101 to 200 instead of 1 to 100).

If you want the different scenarios to have different process
error you will need to make separate calls to `run_ss3sim` for
each scenario and pass a different matrix of `user_recdevs`
(see [the section on process noise](#pro-error)) or pass different iteration numbers.
For most applications this should not be necessary.

The observation error seed
(affecting the index, length composition, and age composition sampling)
is set during the OM generation.
Therefore, a given iteration-case-file-argument combination will generate repeatable results.
Given that different case arguments can generate different sampling routines
(e.g. stochastically sampling or not sampling from the age compositions
or sampling a different number of years)
the observation error is not necessarily comparable across different case arguments.

# Parallel computing with ss3sim {#parallel}

ss3sim can easily run multiple scenarios in parallel
to speed up simulations.
To run a simulation in parallel,
you need to register multiple cores or clusters and
set `parallel = TRUE` in `run_ss3sim`.
For example, we could have run the previous example in parallel
with the following code.
First, we register four cores:

```{r, parallel-one, eval=FALSE}
require(doParallel)
registerDoParallel(cores = 4)
```

We can check to make sure we are set up to run in parallel:

```{r, parallel-two, eval=FALSE}
require(foreach)
getDoParWorkers()

#> [1] 4
```

And then run our simulation on four cores simultaneously
by setting `parallel = TRUE`:

```{r, parallel-three, eval=FALSE}
run_ss3sim(iterations = 1, scenarios =
  c("D1-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D2-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D1-E1-F0-R0-M0-cod",
    "D2-E1-F0-R0-M0-cod"),
  case_folder = case_folder, om_dir = om, em_dir = em,
  bias_adjust = TRUE, parallel = TRUE)
```

In addition to the check with `getDoParWorkers()` above,
if the simulations are running in parallel,
you will also see simultaneous output messages
from ss3sim as the simulations run.
On a 2.27 GHz Intel Xeon quad-core server running Ubuntu 12.04,
this example ran 1.9 times faster on two cores than on a single core,
and 3.2 times faster on four cores.

Alternatively, you can run iterations in parallel. This is useful, for
example, if you want to run a single scenario as quickly as possible.
To do this, just set `parallel_iterations = TRUE` as well
as setting `parallel = TRUE`. For example:

```{r, parallel-iterations1, eval=FALSE}
run_ss3sim(iterations = 1:2, scenarios = "D0-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
  case_folder = case_folder, om_dir = om, em_dir = em,
  parallel = TRUE, parallel_iterations = TRUE)
```

If you are running bias adjustment iterations, these will be run first in
serial. The rest of the iterations will be run in parallel:

```{r, parallel-iterations2, eval=FALSE}
run_ss3sim(iterations = 1:2, scenarios = "D0-E0-F0-R0-M0-cod",
  case_folder = case_folder, om_dir = om, em_dir = em,
  parallel = TRUE, parallel_iterations = TRUE, bias_nsim = 2,
  bias_adjust = TRUE)
```

# Putting SS3 in your path {#path}

Instead of copying the SS3 binary file (`ss3.exe` or `ss3`) to each folder
within a simulation and running it, ss3sim relies on a single binary file
being available to the operating system regardless of the folder.
To accomplish this, SS3 must be in your system path, which is
a list of folders that your operating system looks in
whenever you type the name of a program on the command line.
This approach saves on storage space since the SS3 binary is about 2.2 MB and
having it located in each folder can be prohibitive in a large-scale simulation
testing study.

## For Unix (OS X and Linux)

To check if SS3 is in your path:
open a Terminal window and type `which SS3` and hit enter.
If you get nothing returned, then SS is not in your path.
The easiest way to fix this is to move the SS3 binary
to a folder that's already in your path.
To find existing path folders type `echo $PATH`
in the terminal and hit enter.
Now move the SS3 binary to one of these folders.
For example, in a Terminal window type:

    sudo cp ~/Downloads/SS3 /usr/bin/

You will need to use `sudo`
and enter your password after to have permission
to move a file to a folder like `/usr/bin/`.

Also note that you may need to add executable permissions to the SS3 binary
after downloading it.
You can do that by switching to the folder where you placed the binary
(`cd /usr/bin/` if you followed the instructions above),
and running the command:

    sudo chmod +x SS3

Check that SS3 is now executable and in your path:

    which SS3

If you followed the instructions above, you will see the following line returned:

    /usr/bin/SS3

If you have previously modified your path to add a non-standard location
for the SS3 binary,
you may need to also tell R about the new path.
The path that R sees may not include additional paths
that you have added through a configuration file like `.bash_profile`.
If needed, you can add to the path that R sees
by including a line like this in your `.Rprofile` file.
(This is an invisible file in your home directory.)

    Sys.setenv(PATH=paste(Sys.getenv("PATH"),"/my/folder",sep=":"))

## For Windows

To check if SS is in your path for Windows 7 and 8:
open a DOS prompt and type `ss3 -?` and hit enter.
If you get a line like `ss3 is not recognized...`
then SS3 is not in your path.
To add the SS3 binary file to your path, follow these steps:

1. Find the correct version of the `ss3.exe` binary on your computer

2. Record the folder location. E.g. `C:/SS3.24o/`

3. Click on the start menu and type `environment`

4. Choose `Edit environment variables for your account` under Control Panel

5. Click on `PATH` if it exists, create it if does not exist

6. Choose `PATH` and click edit

7. In the `Edit User Variable` window add to the **end** of the `Variable value`
   section a semicolon and the SS3 folder location you recorded earlier.
   E.g. `;C:/SS3.24o/`.
   **Do not overwrite what was previously in the PATH variable**.

8. Restart your computer

9. Go back to the DOS prompt and try typing `ss3 -?` and hitting return again.
