\title{Predict length given VBGF parameters}
\usage{
vbgf_func(L1, L.inf, k, ages, a3)
}
\arguments{
\item{L1}{mean length at youngest age which is well sampled in the data (a3)}

\item{L.inf}{Length at infinity}

\item{k}{von Bertalanffy growth rate parameter}

\item{ages}{vector of ages in the data for which you want to predict mean
length-at-age}

\item{a3}{youngest age which is well sampled in the data}
}
\value{
a vector of lengths predicted which correspond to the input ages
vector.
}
