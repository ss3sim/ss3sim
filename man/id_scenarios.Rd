\title{Identify scenarios in \code{directory}}
\usage{
id_scenarios(directory)
}
\arguments{
\item{directory}{The directory that you want to search for scenarios.
The search is recursive, and thus, it is in one's best interest to
provide a shorter path name rather than one high up in the call stack.}
}
\value{
A character vector of relative paths to directories that contain
iterations.
}
\description{
Find folders within \code{directory} that contain iterations,
i.e., "1", "2", "3", ..., and thus, allowing for unique scenario names.
