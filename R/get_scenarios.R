#' Identify scenarios in `directory`
#'
#' Find scenario directories, where it is known if a directory was derived from
#' {ss3sim} and contains iterations of the operating and estimating models if
#' there are directories with numeric names that contain om and/or em
#' directories, i.e., "1", "2", "3", ..., "100".
#' @param directory The directory or vector of directories that you want to
#'   search for scenarios. The search is recursive, and thus, it is in one's
#'   best interest to provide a shorter path name rather than one high up in the
#'   call stack.
#' @param full A logical entry. If `TRUE`, the full path name is returned, which
#'   can be helpful if a vector of directories is supplied to `directory`,
#'   otherwise it is impossible to know which scenarios are located where. If
#'   `FALSE`, a vector of names is returned. This is the default behavior.
#' @return A character vector of names of directories that contain output from
#'   {ss3sim}. Full paths are only provided if `full = TRUE`.
