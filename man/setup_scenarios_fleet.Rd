\title{Set up fleet-specific information}
\usage{
setup_scenarios_fleet(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame of scenario information that was passed to
\code{\link[=setup_scenarios]{setup_scenarios()}} and as subsequently been passed to this function as a
long data frame rather than a wide data frame.}
}
\value{
An augmented data frame is returned in the same form as the
input data. The new rows correspond to parsing input arguments out
across all fleets that are sampled when a single input value is provided.
}
\description{
Sometimes, users will want to pass a single input instead of fleet-specific
information to make things easier to keep track of for the user.
\code{get_fleet} copies this single object over to all fleets
for a given sampling type.
}
\details{
In the data frame that stores scenario-specific information by row,
columns are fleet-specific with the fleet denoted after the last full stop.
If this terminal full stop followed by a numerical value is not supplied,
then the value will be copied for all fleets.
For example, \code{sa.Nsamp.1} specifies the sample size for age-composition data
for fleet number one. Whereas, \code{sa.Nsamp} specifies the input sample-size
for all fleets.

A todo list for future features is as follows:
\itemize{
\item remove fleets that have \code{NA}
\item allow for arguments rather than hard wiring \code{arg} and \code{fleet}
\item see if \code{sa.Nsamp} and \code{sa.Nsamp.1} can be in the same data frame and just
fill in the value for fleets that aren't specified; would need to fill
up and down I think within a group to make it work.
\item accommodate -999 in sample function \code{cpar} arguments
\item create \code{add_args} to fill in missing arguments across fleets
\item implement \code{add_args} before expand fleet such that the new
\code{arg} would be expanded for all fleets but I only have to specify
the default one time
\item fix \code{.data[[""]]} to pass CRAN
\code{x <- enquo(x)}
\code{y <- enquo(y)}
\code{ggplot(data) + geom_point(aes(!!x, !!y))}
}
