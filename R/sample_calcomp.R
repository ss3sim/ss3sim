#' Sample conditional age-at-length data
#'
#' Sample conditional age-at-length data from
#' expected values of length proportions and
#' expected values of age proportions (conditional on length)
#' from the operating model (OM) and writes the samples to file for use by the
#' estimation model (EM).
#'
#' @details
#' There are many steps needed to sample conditional age-at-length data because
#' ages are not independent from lengths.
#' The data is located in the data file alongside age compositions.
#' Conditional age-at-length data have one line per length bin.
#' Thus, each row represents the observed age distribution for
#' a length bin conditioned on the fish lengths that were observed in the length compositions.
#' The age distribution will be truncated for older or younger fish.
#' Often, many rows will be empty because no fish of that length bin were observed.
#' These empty rows are not needed in the data file.
#'
#' The sampling process includes the following steps:
#'
#' 1. Lengths are sampled based on the desired number of lengths, $N$.
#'    $N$ is the maximum amount that could be aged.
#' 2. Those lengths are binned to create a length distribution, i.e.,
#'    numbers of fish in each length bin.
#' 3. Ages are sampled from fish that contributed to the length distribution.
#'    Several strategies are possible for sampling ages from those fish
#'
#'   1. age all fish,
#'   2. _take random subset of fish independent of length bin_, or
#'   3. take a fixed number of fish from each length bin.
#'
#' ss3sim can currently only handle randomly sampling ages from
#' fish with length measurements.
#' Future versions could include the last option;
#' please contact the developers if you are interested in helping.
#'
#' Note that the overall total sample size
#' for all conditional age-at-length bins is specified by
#' the user for the given fleet and year in `Nsamp_ages`.
#' These sample sizes and the expected values of age proportions
#' (conditional on length) are used to sample for realistic age proportions.
#' If all fish are aged,
#' then no resampling is performed.
#' If no fish are aged for a row of age proportions in conditional age at length data,
#' then that row is discarded.
#' If all fish are not aged,
#' then a new sample size must be drawn.
#' This new sample size must be less than or equal to
#' the number of fish that were sampled for their length.
#' This new sample size is used to draw ages randomly from the expected values.
#' If we consider all rows for a fleet and year (one for each length bin),
#' the sum will be the sample size for the conditional age-at-length data.
#' However, if the sample size is less than the length sample size,
#' we need to be careful to not age more fish in a length bin
#' than were in that length bin in the first place.
#' We accomplish this in the code by
#' doing sampling without replacement for vectors of length bins equal to the number of fish in them.
#' This ensures realistic sampling.
#' If the option (3) above were implemented,
#' a different strategy would need to be implemented.
#' For instance,
#' if the user wants 10 fish from each length bin but only 5 fish were observed,
#' what to do?
#' `NULL` for fleets indicates to delete the conditional age-at-length data but
#' not the marginal age data.
#'
#' When Dirichlet sampling is used for length compositions,
#' the number of fish observed will be real-valued and not whole fish.
#' One cannot simply multiply by the length composition sample size to get
#' whole numbers because they are real and
#' rounding or truncating would be unsatisfactory.
#' Currently, the function simply draws a multinomial sample from the
#' length compositions of specified size (`Nsamp`).
#' However, this does not guarantee that fewer fish are aged than
#' measured for length.
#' If you are specifying a small number of fish to age relative to length,
#' then this might be alright.
#' However, *we discourage the use of Dirichlet length samples*
#' when using conditional age-at-length data as currently implemented.
#'
#' Note that this function cannot handle all types of sampling.
#' This function requires that there be a row of conditional age-at-length data
#' for each length data bin (for each year and fleet that sampling is specified to be performed),
#' where `Lbin_lo` and `Lbin_hi` are the same value.
#' Note also that this sampling procedure represents simple random sampling, where
#' (1) lengths are sampled randomly,
#' (2) fish are measured for length and placed into bins, and
#' (3) a subset of fish with length measurements are aged,
#'     where a constant proportion from each length bin are selected for aging.
#' This does not represent length stratified sampling where a subset of
#' fish with length measurements are aged, and
#' a constant number from each length bin is selected for aging,
#' although these data could also be put into a Stock Synthesis model
#' as conditional age-at-length data.

#' @param exp_vals_list This is a data list containing all expected values. It
#'   should not be modified by previous sampling functions to contain sampled
#'   data.
#' @template outfile
#' @param Nsamp_lengths A numeric list of the same length as fleets. Either
#'  single values or vectors of the same length as the number of years can be
#'  passed through. Single values are repeated for all years. If no fleet
#'  collected samples, specify `Nsamp_lengths = NULL`. Specifically, for
#'  `sample_calcomp`, `Nsamp_lengths` denotes the total number of
#'  length samples for a given year and fleet across all length bins that can be
#'  used to then sample the conditional age at length samples.
#'  `Nsamp_lengths` must be greater than or equal to `Nsamp_ages`.
#' @param Nsamp_ages A numeric list of the same length as fleets. Either single
#'  values or vectors of the same length as the number of years can be passed
#'  through. Single values are repeated for all years. If no fleet collected
#'  samples, specify `Nsamp_ages = NULL`. Specifically, for
#'  `sample_calcomp`, `Nsamp_ages` denotes the total number of
#'  conditional age at length samples for a given year and fleet across all
#'  length bins. `Nsamp_ages` must be less than `Nsamp_lengths`.
#' @param method The method used to sample ages from the lengths. Options are
#'   "simple_random" and "length_stratified". In "simple_random" (the default
#'   option), the fish aged are randomly sampled from the age bins, so the number
#'   sampled in each age bin is not equal. In "length_stratified", an equal
#'   number of fish are aged from each length bin.
#' @param ESS_lengths  The final effective sample size (ESS) associated with the
#'  simulated length data generated for conditional age at length samples. The
#'  ESS is not used to generate the simulated data but can be used as an input
#'  sample size in subsequent models that estimate population parameters or
#'  status. The default, NULL, leads to the true (internally calculated)
#'  effective sample size being used, which is `Nsamp_lengths` for the
#'  multinomial case. `ESS_lengths` should be a numeric list of the same
#'  length as fleets. Either single values or vectors of the same length as the
#'  number of years can be passed through. Single values are repeated for all
#'  years. Note that the dimensions of ESS_lengths must be compatible with the
#'  dimensions of `Nsample_lengths`.
#' @param ESS_ages The final effective sample size (ESS) associated with the
#'  simulated conditional age at length data. The ESS is not used to generate
#'  the simulated data but can be used as an input sample size in subsequent
#'  models that estimate population parameters or status. The default, NULL,
#'  leads to the true (internally calculated) effective sample size being used,
#'  which is `Nsamp_ages` for the multinomial case. `ESS_ages` should be
#'  a numeric list of the same length as fleets. Either single values or vectors
#'  of the same length as the number of years can be passed through. Single
#'  values are repeated for all years. Note that the dimensions of ESS_lengths
#'  must be compatible with the dimensions of `Nsample_ages`. The input
#'  value will be apportioned among the conditional age at length bins as the
#'  `Nsamp_ages` is and therefore can be a fractional value.
#' @param lcomps_sampled Have marginal length comps already been sampled and are
#'  included in `dat_list[["lencomp"]]`? If `FALSE`, expected values are in
#'  present in `datlist[["lencomp"]]`.
